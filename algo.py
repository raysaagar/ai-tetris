Tetrais - Tetris AI

By Saagar Deshpande, Louis Li, Brandon Sim

Tetris game logic based on code from:
https://github.com/adhit/tetris

Basic game functionalities:
    - Board is represented by a two dimensional matrix, `grid`
    - A state is represented by a dict with keys "board" and "pieces", 
      where "pieces" is the remaining pieces (thus piece[0] is the next piece)
    - print_grid for a beautiful ASCII representation of your configuration
